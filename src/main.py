# Get batch parameters
# These should come from a file at some point.
dimension = 2

core_counts = [5, 10]
mappings = ['hilbert', 'zorder']
nearest_neighbor_counts = [2, 3]
nearness_ranges = [1, 2]

# Run experiment batch.

# sort point & core counts to be used as stacks.

# while point count not empty
# pop point count
# generate point_count points
# construct distance matrix
# get ordered list of near neighbors (within distances r0-ri)
# get ordered list of nearest neighbors (for k0-ki # of neighbors)
# metric: get avg. distance to k0-ki nearest neighbors,

# Dump data to file.
